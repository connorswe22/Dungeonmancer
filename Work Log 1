The Dungeonmancer project was started and an initial UI Design was created
The 3 pages (Main Menu, Character List, and Character Creator) have all been created as levels in Unreal Engine 5. Blueprint programming was done so that the user could
successfully navigate between the three pages with buttons created in the pages. Some visual design choices were also made such as font, backgrounds, and colors.
